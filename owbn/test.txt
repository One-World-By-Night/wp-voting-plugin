Also an overview of the various methods below to discuss how rounds work in each…

Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)

Process:
 
	1. First Round: Voters rank candidates in order of preference. Each voter’s first choice is counted initially. - checkbox
	2.	Elimination: If no candidate receives a majority (>50%) of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.
    - check total voters divided by 2 multiply by 100 
	3.	Redistribution: Voters who selected the eliminated candidate as their first choice have their votes transferred to their next preferred candidate still in the race.
	4.	Subsequent Rounds: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a candidate receives a majority of votes and is declared the winner.


Rounds:

	•	Multiple rounds of counting and eliminating the least popular candidate until one candidate secures a majority.

	
Single Transferrable Vote (STV)

Process:

	1.	First Round: Voters rank candidates in order of preference. Each candidate needs a certain number of votes, called the “quota,” to be elected.
	2.	Quota Calculation: The quota is often determined by the Droop formula: \text{Quota} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Votes}}{\text{Number of Seats} + 1}\right) + 1.
	3.	Election of Candidates: Candidates who reach the quota are elected.
	4.	Transfer of Surplus Votes: Surplus votes of elected candidates (votes exceeding the quota) are transferred to voters’ next preferences at a fraction of their value.
	5.	Elimination and Redistribution: If no candidate meets the quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the next preferred candidate still in the race.
	6.	Subsequent Rounds: Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until all seats are filled.

Rounds:

	•	Multiple rounds of transferring surplus votes and eliminating the least popular candidates until all positions are filled.

Condorcet Voting

Process:

	1.	Pairwise Comparison: Each candidate is compared head-to-head with every other candidate. Voters indicate their preference between each pair.
	2.	Winning Candidate: A candidate wins a pairwise comparison if they are preferred over the other candidate by more voters.
	3.	Condorcet Winner: The candidate who wins all pairwise comparisons against other candidates (if one exists) is the winner.

Rounds:

	•	The process involves one round of pairwise comparisons but can include multiple comparisons to ensure the Condorcet criterion is met.

Comparison and Contrast

Similarities:

	•	Preference Ranking: All three methods involve voters ranking candidates in order of preference.
	•	Elimination and Redistribution: IRV and STV both use elimination and redistribution of votes. In STV, this happens along with the transfer of surplus votes.
	•	Majority Requirement: IRV and Condorcet focus on achieving a majority or overall preference, while STV aims for proportional representation.

Differences:

	•	Purpose and Outcome:
	•	IRV: Focuses on finding a single winner who has broad support, eliminating the least popular candidates sequentially.
	•	STV: Used in multi-member constituencies to achieve proportional representation by filling multiple seats.
	•	Condorcet: Seeks to identify a candidate who would win against each of the other candidates in a head-to-head competition, ensuring the most broadly preferred candidate wins if one exists.
	•	Complexity:
	•	IRV: Relatively simple to understand and implement for single-winner elections.
	•	STV: More complex due to the quota calculation and surplus vote transfers, suitable for proportional representation.
	•	Condorcet: Conceptually simple but can be complex in terms of computations and resolving cycles (e.g., if no single candidate wins all pairwise comparisons).
	•	Rounds of Voting:
	•	IRV and STV: Involve multiple rounds of counting and redistribution until a clear winner(s) emerges.
	•	Condorcet: Involves a single round of pairwise comparisons, though it might need additional steps to resolve ties or cycles.

Each method has its strengths and is suitable for different types of elections, with IRV being ideal for single-winner elections, STV for proportional representation in multi-member districts, and Condorcet for identifying the most broadly preferred candidate in single-winner elections.
